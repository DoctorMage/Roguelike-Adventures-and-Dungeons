### ancientbeasts-1.9.99999.jar
3rd time's the charm I suppose,

this is a small patch with tweaks that might go unnoticed, kunai and ice spikes aiming has been improved, that's it :P.

### ancientbeasts-1.9.9999.jar
Halloween update!, luckily for us this time it is still October, and not only in our hearts.

Meet our 2 new spooky mobs for this time around

*   Nekros: a scary necromancer ghost
*   Bonepile: a two headed skeleton that is rarely seen lurking in the overworld

With them we have new items:

*   Dark essence: A potion ingredient, and for the (hopefully not so far) future a very important item
*   A very unique weapon: You might want to take down a bonepile to see what it is...

There is also a load of tweaks and changes with this update:

*   Netherhounds now can sometimes ram at their target instead of only chasing them.
*   Sandmonster has been rebalanced and now can dodge attacks sometimes, apart from a sort of Hit and run attack AI.
*   Zealot has been reworked on some aspects to cause less lag / fps drops..
*   Fixed a bunch of issues related with ghosts.
*   Giant had a few improvements to how it works, making it more challeging
*   Reworked Vessel, not only visually but the fight has changed a bit and now it should be more fun.
*   Rifted enderman beam can now be correctly blocked with shields.
*   New sounds for the shielded potion effect.
*   Owlstacks now only affect undead (can be changed in config) and there is a mob blacklist for the mobs they should scare away.
*   A handful amount of retextures.

There is also a few things from next update (aka 2.0)

*   Thatch & Block of sticks: two building blocks.

## Roguelike Dungeons -- Fnar's Edition
[CurseForge Link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fnars-roguelike-dungeons)

### v2.4.3 Mob Spawner Fix Patch
🐛 Fix issues with mob spawners:  
- Entity gear was not enchanted (and was actually wrong) as it was being overwritten by the originally-spawned mob's gear  
- The above lead to shield designs and enchantments not manifesting on gear (or any other NBT)

🐛 Fix issue where mobs were sometimes wearing random armour on their heads  
- This was due to the Mob equipper logic in Mob.java not taking an armour type. Sometimes, when rolling for a helmet, it would generate a special chestpiece, leggings, or boots that the mob would wear on their head. Pretty funny, honestly.

**Full Changelog**: [https://github.com/fnar/minecraft-roguelike/compare/v2.4.2...v2.4.3](https://github.com/fnar/minecraft-roguelike/compare/v2.4.2...v2.4.3)

### v.2.4.2 overrideMobEquipmentEnchantmentLevels Config Patch
✨ Introduce new chest types, `GARDEN`, `JUNK`, and `MAGIC`  
✨Introduce new configuration: "overrideMobEquipmentEnchantmentLevels"  
- Optional List of integers in the range -1:MAX_INT that represents the level of which equipment should be enchanted when spawning a mob that has enchanted gear on that dungeon level. Each subsequent integer maps to a dungeon layer level (e.g. first layer, second layer, ... currently only 5 layers exist with indices 0-4). E.g., with the value "-1,10,15,20,30", the first level (index 0) would use the mod's internal leveling for enchanting gear, then would enchant dungeon level 2 at enchantment level 10, then dungeon level 3 at enchantment level 15, etc.

This feature was specifically requested by @shivaxi ([https://twitter.com/shivaxi](https://twitter.com/shivaxi)) to help solve a problem with RLCraft ([https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/rlcraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/rlcraft)) and So Many Enchantments ([https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/so-many-enchantments](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/so-many-enchantments)) where mobs enchanted by Roguelike Dungeons disproportionately have armour enchanted with Thorns, Advanced Thorns, and Fiery Thorns. The root cause is due to the prevalence of damage-reflect enchantments, the lack of competing enchantments for armour, and the high level that Roguelike Dungeons prefers to enchant gear at. Despite suggestions to reduce the number of damage-reflection enchantments, or to further reduce their occurrence, this seemed to be the path of least resistance. Crush it, Shiv.

**Full Changelog**: [https://github.com/fnar/minecraft-roguelike/compare/v2.4.1...v2.4.2](https://github.com/fnar/minecraft-roguelike/compare/v2.4.1...v2.4.2)

## Spartan Weaponry
[CurseForge Link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spartan-weaponry)

### SpartanWeaponry-1.12.2-1.5.1.jar
##### **IMPORTANT NOTE:**

Better Combat Rebirth compatibility has been replaced with RLCombat compatibility, which is an updated fork of that mod. Make sure to update to RLCombat if you have Better Combat Rebirth installed. Find it here: [https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rlcombat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rlcombat)

##### **Bugfixes:**

- Fixed the boomerang doing damage to the player throwing it when catching it... again!

##### **Changes in version 1.5.0:**

##### **Additions:**

- Replaced Better Combat Rebirth with RLCombat; an updated fork of that mod  
- Removed compatibility patches for Better Combat Rebirth, due to changes in the updated RLCombat's code that uses events instead  
- The mod now enforces version 2.0.5 of RLCombat or higher to be used if BetterCombat Rebirth or RLCombat is installed  
- Added Sweep 1 as normal sweep damage and the old Sweep 1 and 2 is now Sweep 2 and 3, like Spartan Weaponry 2.x and above  
- Added Sweep 1 to the following weapons: Katana, Longsword and Saber  
- Added a level getter method for Weapon Properties  
- Added a tooltip for Crossbows for Bolt Speed multiplier  
- Added variation of loading time and aim time for the crossbow which is affected by the material's harvest level  
- Added variation of draw time and arrow speed for the longbow which is also affected by the material's harvest level  
- Added compatibility for So Many Enchantments versions of Sharpness (Lesser, Advanced and Supreme) with throwing weapons  
- Re-added the longbow multiplier config value (I forgot I removed it)  
- The default longbow multiplier is now 1.1 instead of 1.25 since the multiplier increases with the item  
- Added config option to let Longbows and Crossbow material modifiers per harvest level to be adjusted. e.g. Draw ticks and arrow speed for Longbows; Load ticks, Aim ticks and bolt speed for Crossbows

##### **Bugfixes:**

- Uncommented a null check that resulted in the recreation of the Quiver model every frame! That was a massive oversight which was only intended for real-time editing of the Quiver model. You can have your FPS back now.  
- Removed an redundant check in the throwing weapon update tick that caused throwing weapon ammo to be duplicated when using the Return enchantment. This should hopefully fix the throwing weapons orbitting players as well.  
- Fixed a duping bug where picking up the Expanse-enchanted original stack of a throwing weapon on the ground while having a non-original stack of the same weapon in the player's inventory resulted in a miscalculation of the ammo count due to different maximum capacities  
- Fixed Armor Piercing projectile damage not being affected by qualities from Quality Tools  
- Fixed damage modifier bugs for throwing weapons where only the most recent damage modifying Weapon Property was being applied and overriding previous ones  
- Fixed not being able to catch Boomerangs in mid-air on a server  
- Fixed the Sweeping Edge enchantment compatibility due to changes in the Sweep Weapon Property  
- Removed Better Combat compatibility using rather 'hacky' methods in favor of better integrated Events from RLCombat, hence why Better Combat Rebirth won't work with this mod anymore  
- Reimplemented speed-based Riding Damage Bonus weapon property for Lances. RLCombat now adds compatibility for sending speed to the server so it should work properly now

##### **Tweaks:**

- Heavily reduced the FOV effect when using the bow and crossbow to be closer to the vanilla bow  
- Added a check to prevent this mods attack packets being sent when RLCombat is loaded because RLCombat handles that when available  
- Lots of code cleanup which is why this version is roughtly the same size as the previous one- Added a check to prevent this mods attack packets being sent when RLCombat is loaded because RLCombat handles that when available

- Uncommented a null check that resulted in the recreation of the Quiver model every frame! That was a massive oversight which was only intended for real-time editing of the Quiver model. You can have your FPS back now.  
- Removed an redundant check in the throwing weapon update tick that caused throwing weapon ammo to be duplicated when using the Return enchantment. This should hopefully fix the throwing weapons orbitting players as well.  
- Fixed a duping bug where picking up the Expanse-enchanted original stack of a throwing weapon on the ground while having a non-original stack of the same weapon in the player's inventory resulted in a miscalculation of the ammo count due to different maximum capacities  
- Fixed Armor Piercing projectile damage not being affected by qualities from Quality Tools  
- Fixed damage modifier bugs for throwing weapons where only the most recent damage modifying Weapon Property was being applied and overriding previous ones  
- Fixed not being able to catch Boomerangs in mid-air on a server  
- Fixed the Sweeping Edge enchantment compatibility due to changes in the Sweep Weapon Property  
- Removed Better Combat compatibility using rather 'hacky' methods in favor of better integrated Events from RLCombat, hence why Better Combat Rebirth won't work with this mod anymore  
- Reimplemented speed-based Riding Damage Bonus weapon property for Lances. RLCombat now adds compatibility for sending speed to the server so it should work properly now

##### **Tweaks:**

- Heavily reduced the FOV effect when using the bow and crossbow to be closer to the vanilla bow  
- Added a check to prevent this mods attack packets being sent when RLCombat is loaded because RLCombat handles that when available  
- Lots of code cleanup which is why this version is roughtly the same size as the previous one- Added a check to prevent this mods attack packets being sent when RLCombat is loaded because RLCombat handles that when available
