## RAD 1.52 IS OUT

Get a refreshing feeling as you re-discover new items, or remember those you always forgot existed!
Be relieved from the stress of gaming with a bit of humor as you read the titles and subtitles of quests, as well as their snazzy new descriptions, which will boast an extra smile or give some helpful insight!

This revamp project was created by our community member I Mayk Kwuests#6697 so all credits and energy goes to him.
Special thanks to Samara#0323 for active template creation!

## Features of the new update include:

* A some Chapters remade from scratch with massive attention to detail ranging from humorous quest names and titles to new informative descriptions. Progression should now be streamlined in a fashion where you should progress through the Chapter just by playing the game. 
* The Building Gadgets mod will be replaced or accompanied by the Capsules mod.
* Items which eventually become useless, like Manuscripts, unlock items for the Titles mod, and more, will now have a use in the Questbook
* The Shop is receiving a huge revamp. All tabs will be remade for more appropriate organization of items. Tons of items have been added
* New changes to the configs

 

There will be notification about missing entries in your save file - that's totally OK.
Just confirm, game will make a backup of your world just in case.
