        # This is slightly complex, so please read carefully! Tiers allow you to add different levels of power and cooldown to dodging depending on how heavy the armor the player is wearing is. You format each tier like so: minimumWeightToAccessTier=powerOfTier/cooldownOfTier, and seperate each tier with a comma. The tiers NEED to increase in weight requirements, so for example, the first tier must always start at 0, then the next could start at 5... then 7... and so on. The last tier you enter will prevent the player from dodging regardless of the power or cooldown you set. So for example 100=100/0 would completely prevent the player from dodging if they had a weight of over 100.
