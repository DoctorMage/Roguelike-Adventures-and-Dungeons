# Growing Gardens
___

Several different types of Gardens grow across different biomes in the world.

Gardens share few crops between them, encouraging you to go out and collect each crop from all of them.

To collect crops from a Garden, Left-click or destroy it.

It move a Garden and permit it to grow, as is said in the mod notes (I have not seen Gardens spread), Shift Left-click. This will drop the Garden item itself.
