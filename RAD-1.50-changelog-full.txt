===============================================================================================================================
DISCLAIMER: Some changes may have been done during non-public or private testing phases. Not all changes are or will be experienced by the public until final release.

READ ME: You will likely need to remake your world if you wish to experience all portions of this update to their fullest extent.
	 We hope that 6 months has been ample time to play in a world you feel satisfied with the amount of work you have put in between the updates. 
	 If you wish to keep those worlds, I personally recommend you rename your instance to something memorable. Then, for the new update, make a brand new instance. 
	 This will keep your old world playable (albeit only at 1.49, and NOT 1.49a) and totally separate from your old instances. 


**MOD ADDITIONS AND REMOVAL**

ADDITIONS

• Lands of Icaria (A vast dimension inspired by ancient greek & egyptian mythology.)

• Added MTLib ModTweaker Dependecy (ModTweaker Library for future configurations to recipes, Vis amounts on certain items, and much, much more)
• Added HarvestCraftTweaker (CraftTweaker support addon for Pam's HarvestCraft; recipe changes and additions in the future)
• Added ModTweaker (CraftTweaker support addon for additional mods)
• Added Future MC (Backported Vanilla Content; not everything is perfect but this is the most reliable backport)
• Added End Reborn (New End Content)
• Added The Midnight (New early game horror-themed Dimension)
• Added The Midnight Rifting Machine Mod (Midnight Dimension Teleporting; because finding a Red Rift all the time can be a hassle to some)
• Added Pam's Pigskin (Immersive QoL; leather from pigs)
• Added Pam's Squid Milking (Immersive QoL; milking squid for Ink Sacs; curves how rare they can be)

• Added Roost (Not a typo; this is that chicken resource mod, but with only one nesting item and none of the extra crap)
• Added Twilight Forest Spell Pack by Electroblob (Twilight Forest Spell & Artifact Additions; have fun)
• Added Mo' Spells Mowzies Mob Spell Pack by Dan (Mowzies Mob Spell & Artifact Additions; have fun)

• Added Thaumic Periphery (Small TC6 Addon; moderate TC6 addon)
• Added Thaumic Wonders (Moderate TC6 addon; large TC6 addon)
• Added Wizardry Fates by Dan (Spell Discipline Mod; with the way I've configured the mod (hopefully), this will the ability to gain permanent buffs to your Spell Potency for each element; they are small, but permanent)
• Added Thaumic Restoration (Small TC6 Addon; moderate TC6 addon)
• Added Lizard Dogo Mod (Single Mob; is lizard; is good lizard)
• Added Ancient Beasts Mod (High Quality Monster Mod; have fun; most seem to be intended to be boss enemies; PLEASE report on spawn rarity criticisms)
• Added Bone Torch Mod (Single Block; you know you've always needed this at some point for some build somewhere; have fun)

• Added Better Displays
• Save My Stronghold

REMOVAL

• Removed Heroic Armory (We know you all loved the mod, but we have better things planned for the item space it gives us; our changed version of the mod was also not able to be used without grey-areas due to reusing assets from the original mod)
• Removed Better Diving (Issues with materials not spawning; something about the config doesn't work?; mod is incomplete anyways)
• Removed Pyramid Plunder (Could not edit loot tables for satisfying loot. Emeralds, Diamonds and Gold all the times is not fun)
• Potentially Removing Better Mineshafts (Testing conflicts with OTG 9.4; currently reverted back to OTG 9.3 for first phase testing)
• Removed Essentia Brazier (Privately Tested; not a good fit)
• Removed Blue Skies (Privately Tested; not a good fit)
• Removed Bewitchment (Privately Tested; good fit; needs more testing)
• Removed The Maelstrom (Privately Tested; not a good fit)

• Removed Callable Horses (Exploit with infinite horses... and item duping or something)

**MODS UPDATED**

• Updated Electroblobs Wizardry
• Updated Ancient Spellcraft
• Reverted OTG 9.4 to 9.3; we'll be keeping Better Mineshafts, for now; we will test conflicts between OTG and Better Mineshafts and come to a conclussion later on what will be changed in the end)

CYCLIC
• Disabled Enhanced Shears; crashing games on shearing plants in The Betweenlands.

DIM DOORS
• Removed the rifts (black swirly clusters); players are always worried about them anyways; they're not particularly useful either.

Enchanting has received a large rework

ENCHANTING CHANGES
• Books no longer stack
• Unrestricted enchanting is gone
• You can now combine books to as high levels as you want instead of it being on weapons or tools compared to before to level up enchants


INVENTORY PETS
• Pets that are disabled have had their recipe and existence removed from jei (they can still be aquired for now due to chest loot and meta pet which will be fixed in future update). 
• Changes to enabled and disabled pets; need to get what changed from Mage...

QUALITY REFORGE
• Added reforging materials for:
	Clockwork Pickaxe = Dawnstone Ingot
	Clockwork Battleaxe = Dawnstone Ingot
	Grandhammer = Dawnstone Ingot
	Dawnstone Mail = Dawnstone Ingot
	Amulet of the Heretic = Archaic Brick or Archaic Circuit
	Ashen Amulet = Archaic Brick
	Mantle Bulb = Dawnstone Ingot

	Crimson Praetor Helm = Crimson Cloth
	Crimson Praetor Chestplate = Crimson Cloth
	Crimson Praetor Greaves = Crimson Cloth

	Bizzoula also added reforge materials for all Wizardry Artifacts, I believe. Some addons may be excluded, since they are new additions and will need to have their reforge materials added in the future. We'll pin that.

QUARK
• Re-enabled Pipes

UNIQUE ENCHANTS
• Config was reloaded; if you are keeping your world, you will need to reload this config; we don't recommend you keep your world for this update anyways; we will let you know when it is okay to keep worlds, but usually we'll suggest you remake them)
