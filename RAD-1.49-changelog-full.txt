Rad 1.49 Part 1 of Revamp Changes

RAD Revamped is here! 

Shop revamps! New reward tables! Loot crates! CHAPTERS! UNLOCKABLES! CUSTOM ITEMS! GUIDES TO EACH MOD! AND MORE!
Get a refreshing feeling as you re-discover new items, or remember those you always forgot existed!
Be relieved from the stress of gaming with a bit of humor as you read the titles and subtitles of quests, as well as their snazzy new descriptions, which will boast an extra smile or give some helpful insight!

This revamp project was completely created by our community member @I Mayk Kwuests#6697 so all credits and energy goes to him.
Special thanks to @Samara#0323 for active template creation!

Features of the new update will include:

• A brand new FTB Questbook remade from scratch with massive attention to detail ranging from humorous quest names and titles to new informative descriptions. Random jokes, references to pop culture, and homages to old series can be found in many different texts now.

Progression should now be streamlined in a fashion where you should progress through the Questbook just by playing the game.  You should never feel lost or overwhelmed with this new Questbook.

• Quests with multiple variants of items have had their variants added to the quest. These quests have been made OR quests, and only require you to acquire one type of variant, such as crafting your first Chest.

• TONS more repeatable quests in “The Grind Don’t Stop” Chapter, and longer quest trees should give most mods higher play time, and replay ability. Most hostile mobs as well as bosses from each mod now have a repeatable quest, as well as new repeatable quest turn-ins for different materials like Electrum, Ironwood, and Valonite Blocks.

• The Building Gadgets mod has allowed me to organize a new feature which will help players share their builds through the use of the Building Gadgets mod! Please see the pinned messages for context on this feature.

• Items which eventually become useless, like Manuscripts, unlock items for the Titles mod, and more, will now have a use in the Questbook. You’ll find these new quests in the appropriate Chapters for the mod the item belongs to.

• A new Chapter with “achievement” like quests will also be added. This new Chapter will have ridiculously challenging quests which are not intended to be completed in one sitting. These quests will take many, many hours to complete, ranging from things like fishing up 50,000 fish, to enchanting 10,000 items. Completing one is sure to net you a great reward! 
 
• The Shop is receiving a huge revamp. All tabs will be remade for more appropriate organization of items. Tons of items have been added; these range from misc. tools like Grapple Hooks and Torch Throwers to things like Diamonds, and Valonite, after you’ve discovered enough of the appropriate mineral.

The Shop will only feature very basic items, and will require players to complete quests to unlock more items in the Shop. These items range from powerful things like rare Enchanted Books, to cheap Potions of Suicide and expensive Potions of Luck. 

Completing certain challenging quests may allow you to purchase certain common, uncommon, and even rare commodities from the Shop.

• New changes to the config (some have already been released) will be done, like increased magic damage, Trolls being re-enabled, as well as pixies, and changing certain loot tables for dungeons, and spawn rates for certain rare creatures.

•Building Gadgets now has a dedicated channel for build submissions in the RAD Discord server. Come read how to submit your builds to the RAD pack for everyone to see!

•New difficulty balancing for certain mobs should provide a new feeling when playing. Most mobs from Ice and Fire have increased health, as they are fearsome mythical creatures. Dragons are not a joke at any difficulty now, but they shouldn't be killing you outright every time.

Items Disabled In Jei:
⦁ Dragon Horn (been disabled, removed from JEI)
⦁ Sack of Holding (been disabled, removed from JEI)
⦁ Uncrafting Table (been disabled, removed from JEI)
⦁ OpenBlocks Scaffolding (redundant & unreliable)
⦁ Biome Radar (redundant & unreliable,  Biome Crystals cannot be found reliably, Nature's Compass exists)
⦁ Blood Stone (highly undocumented, no desc anywhere, White Stone is not available)
⦁ Slime in a Bucket (there are other items accomplishing the same function without requiring you find a Slime in the first place)
⦁ Quark Item Pipes (redundant; there are no special inventories which are only accessible by Quark pipes, and the pipes are not highly advanced. It's all intangible knowledge you have to memorize to make a half•way decent pipe system. Not worth the hassle of being in JEI)

Embers
•Increased the Y level which the Ember Bore will mine Ember from Y 7 to Y 15
•Blazing Ray DMG increased from 3.5 hearts to to 20 hearts. It is now a formidable weapon into mid•game. Basic armor protects against this item in testing, accounting for what some may think is a drastic increase.
•Blazing Ray charge time increased from 1s to 3s. Charging will increase your output damage.
•Blazing Ray has been given a cooldown between each shot, from 1s to 5s, to account for the damage increase.

•Cinder Staff has been given a cooldown, from 0.5s to 2s, to account for the damage increase.

•Cinder Staff projectile size has been increased from 17 to 20, so the AoE increase does not seem unrealistic. What a nice config option.

Erebus
•Scorpions now grab you! 

Heroic Armory
•All weapons should deal double DMG. This makes them not useless, since they don't have Spartan Weapons extra effects, or any effects at all for that matter.

Ice & Fire
•Increased Cyclops sheep search range slightly. This should help Wandering Cyclops with losing sheep sometimes.
•Cyclops base HP is doubled from 150 to 300. They are now fearsome enemies, like they should've always been.
•Wandering Cyclops should spawn more a bit more often. Increased from 1 in 900 chunk chance to 1 in 700 chunk chance. They're seldom seen, and usually only spawn in Plains, or Forest.
•Dragon melee DMG is increased slightly, from 17 to 20. Dragons bites should actually hurt, no matter the size. No armor? Prepare to die.
•Dragon breath DMG is increased massively, from 2.0 to 4.5. Having proper protections will now be worth it.
•Slightly increased gold pile generation in Dragon Lairs from 4 to 7. Big dragons need big money.
•Base max dragon health increased from 500 to 850. They are now more fearsome enemies. One•shotting dragons should be hard, unless preparations are made.
•Increased dragon wander distance from 40 to 64. Seems to help with dragons flying in circles when the sky is clear of blocks or debris. This is experimental and can be reduced, as it is a known source of server lag. Config: "Dragon Wander From Home Distance"
•Snow Villages increased from 1 in 100 chunks chance to 1 in 300 chunks chance. Snow Villagers can be broken sometimes.
•Pixie Villages can now spawn; 1 in 400 chunk chance. Don't like your items being stolen? Stay away from the thieving buggers.
•Stymphalian Birds spawn rate decreased from 1 in 100 chunk chance to 1 in 200 chunk chance. They're annoying, and make Swamps seem unlivable.
•Increased Stymphalian Bird Flock Length Search radius from 40 to 64. Should help group up birds so there are not multiple small flocks within an area. Provides chances for a mega flock to occur.
•Troll base HP is increased from 70 to 150. They are now fearsome enemies, like they should be.
•Troll base DMG is reduced from 15 to 10. They hit a little hard with Scaling Difficulty in the pack.
•Troll spawnrates reduced from 100 to 20. They spawn ridiculously often in large open caves, since they are larger creatures. Players without BetterCaves may not see them super often, though BetterCaves is a resource hog.
•Increased base world gen distance between structures from 150 blocks to 300 blocks. You should no longer see 2 Gorgon Temples on the same beach.

Mowzies Mobs
•Ferrous Wroughtnaut base DMG is increased by 50%. This makes him a more fearsome enemy, like he should be.
•Ferrous Wroughtnaut base HP is increased by 20%. This should make him a even more fearsome.
•Axe of a Thousand Metals dmg increased from 14 to 35. This makes it a weapon worth obtaining.
•Foliaath base HP is reduced by 50%. They're plants; they scale horrendously with Scaling Difficulty, making them real monsters late•game.
•FrostMaw generation freqency reduced from 1 in 12 chunk chance to 1 in 24 chunk chance.
•FrostMaw base HP is increased by 50% This makes them more fearsome.
•FrostMaw base DMG is increased by 20%.
•The Ice Crystal now does 150% more damage, making it a worthwhile weapon.

•Barakoa Spear DMG is increased from 5 to 15.
•Barakoa Spear ATK Speed is increased from 1.6 to 1.3.
•Naga Fang Dagger DMG increased from 3 damage to 18 damage. The weapon was never viable with 3 damage. Naga are rare, making going out of your way to find this weapon worthwhile. And it looks cool!
•Naga Fang Dagger bonus DMG when attacking from behind increased from 3 to 12. You won't sneak hit mobs unless you have invisibility. The increase to bonus damage is intended for multiplayer.
•Naga Fang Dagger poison effect duration increased from 2s to 5s. This makes the poison effect a scary thing, especially in multiplayer.
•Blow Gun poison duration increased from 2s to 15s. Poison from a Blow Dart should be potent. You can also only obtain Darts from Barakoa. They are not craftable, making this ammo rather valuable.


Pam's HarvestCraft
•Top Tier Food buff time increased from 3 minutes to 10 minutes. Foods now have incentive to be cooked!

Thaumic Augmentations
•Impetus Cannon dmg increased all around, by about 250%. It's an end•game weapon from Thaumcraft with one of the highest time•investment requirements. It should hit hard. We might even make it higher. Who knows. Experimental.

RandomLoot
•Soul Searching effect disabled. Causes issues; doesn't go away when you unequip the piece with the effect.
•Made drop rates for everything inside crates more even. You'll get more of everything, instead of mostly swords/weapons.
