Drawer key locks the contents of a drawer so that it can only store the items that are locked into it (also has the added benefit of showing which items are locked in even if all are taken).

At most you only need one Storage upgrade V (the emerald one) and you never have to worry about item storage again. It increases storage by 32 multiplied by the default amount of the drawer. For example 2x2 would store 16k items with just one emerald upgrade.

There are other upgrades that can give uses for different purposes.
