The core is the main part of any colossal chest and is a requirement for it to work. It acts as the brain of the system and keeps all items inside.

#(WARNING:UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES DO YOU EVER DESTROY THE CORE. IF PART OF THE WALLS ARE BROKEN BUT CORE IS LEFT INTACT IT WILL KEEP ALL ITEMS BUT IF THE CORE IS DESTROYED WHILE THE CHEST IS UN-FORMED ALL ITS CONTENTS WILL BE VOIDED.)

The Interface
