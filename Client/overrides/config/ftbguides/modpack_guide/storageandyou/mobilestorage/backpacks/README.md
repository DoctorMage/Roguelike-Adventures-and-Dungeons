Storage upgrades being 5 tiers each one adding 9 slots to the backpack and very cheap to make allows for you to easily get a maxed backpack before you even halfway into your first dungeon.
But be warned you cannot skip upgrade tiers each upgrade has to be added in order
Wood > Stone > Iron > Gold > Diamond.
A max upgraded backpack supports storing 63 items which unsurprisingly is most likely not enough to store all the loot you're getting while plowing through a dungeon (you can always carry multiple).
